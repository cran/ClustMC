Description: Multiple comparison techniques are typically applied following an F
    test from an ANOVA to decide which means are significantly different from
    one another. As an alternative to traditional methods, cluster analysis
    can be performed to group the means of different treatments into
    non-overlapping clusters. Treatments in different groups are considered
    statistically different. Several approaches have been proposed, with varying
    clustering methods and cut-off criteria. This package implements
    cluster-based multiple comparisons tests and also provides a visual
    representation in the form of a dendrogram. Di Rienzo, J. A., Guzman, A. W.,
